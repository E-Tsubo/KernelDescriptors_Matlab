How to build opencvFunc @ matlab platform
At mac or Linux platform, it is very easy.
Please install OpenCV with macports or apt-get.

At Windows platform, a little difficult.
My environment is follows
--
Windows 7 Pro 64bit
Matlab 2009b
Visual Studio 2008 Pro ( please install x64 compiler )
OpenCV 2.3 ( I installed this at C:\SDK\OpenCV2.3 )
--

My make.m is created with above path.
So, please cheack lib path.
And, when you call mex function from matlab,
it is necessary to load dll file.
opencvFunc needs opencv_core**.dll and openc_imgproc**.dll.
So, please copy dll file and opencvFunc to demo_rgbd folder .

If you want to use Visual Studio2010 with Matlab R2009b,
you must use patch "VS2010MEXSupport.zip".
This patch is distributed by MathWorks.

If you use Visual Studio2010, please read follows,

And, at mc_convert/mc_convert.cpp, line No. is 162,
please comment out "std::copy (it_src1,it_src2,it_dest);".
