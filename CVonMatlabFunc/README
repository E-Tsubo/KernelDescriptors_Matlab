How to build opencvFunc @ matlab platform
At mac or Linux platform, it is very easy.
Please install OpenCV with macports or apt-get.

At Windows platform, a little difficult.
My environment is follows
--
Windows 7 Pro 64bit
Matlab 2009b
Visual Studio 2008 Pro ( please install x64 compiler )
OpenCV 2.3 ( I installed this at C:\SDK\OpenCV2.3 )
--

My make.m is created with above path.
So, please check lib path.
And, when call mex function program from matlab,
it is necessary to load dll file.
opencvFunc needs opencv_core**.dll and openc_imgproc**.dll.
So, please copy dll file and opencvFunc to demo_rgbd folder .
